#### Machine_Learning_Scratch

A collection of information that is needed for the fundamentals on machine learning.
The very starting point is some basic logical information on the two of the widely used programming languages, Python and R.
I will start with Python and my co-author can work on R. 

##### Fundamentals of Programming
If else statements

So for example, we have an _if_ followed by some form of condition.  If the condition is true, then the block is executed and after that the return.  _if_ the condition is not true, the block is not executed and it goes immediately to the return.

1. If conditions

If [some form of expression]:
  [block]
  return [something]


  

2. While loops

while (some condition):
  some action




While loops are used to perform some form of action while (during the time) that the condition is true.  If the condition becomes 0 or false, the line immediately following the loop is executed.
